First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr.~Michael Reiter, for providing me an opportunity to be his student and for his patience, motivation, and knowledge. I enjoy the time discussing with him, and his guidance helped me all the time at UNC. I thank my other committee members: Dr.~Theophilus Benson, Dr.~Rob Sherwood, Dr.~Jasleen Kaur, and Dr.~Prasun Dewan, for their valuable advice, insightful comments, and precious time they committed to serving on my committee.

I am grateful for all my collaborators, including Dr.~Vyas Sekar, who helped me a lot during the first two years of my Ph.D. study; Dr. ~Theophilus Benson, who can always give me useful suggestions for my research; Dr. Muntasir Rahman, who provided me an opportunity to join Bell Labs as an intern; and Dr.~Lalita Jagadeesan and Robert Hanmer who gave me helpful feedback throughout the duration of my internship.
 
Thanks to all my friends, without whom my time at UNC would not be nearly as delightful. In particular, thanks to Andrew Chi, Adam Humphries, Victor Heorhiadi, Jung Jiang, Marie Nesfield, Ke Coby Wang, Qiuyu Xiao, and Ziqiao Zhou. I have been very fortunate to be part of the team.


Last but not least, I would like to thank my parents, Xianxing Liu and Baoying Yao, who always support and encourage me. I thank Ziqiao Zhou, who supports me and endures me nonetheless. I could never have done this without them. I love you all.
